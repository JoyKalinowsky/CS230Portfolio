# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I was very thorough in developing this documentation. I made sure that every response that I made was detailed and consise, so that anybody reading my design documentation would be able to understand the gist of my program. I wanted the reader of my document to walk away with no confusion or further questions on how my program works.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?


# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
