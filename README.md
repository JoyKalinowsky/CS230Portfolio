# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was a game company named The Gaming Room. They wanted me to design an online multiplayer game application called Draw It or Lose It with a REST API that allows users to connect to the game server and communicate with each other. Their previous version of the game application was only available in the form of an Android app. They wanted me to rewrite parts of the software to make it web-based and compatible with most operating systems.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I was very thorough in developing this documentation. I made sure that every response that I made was detailed and concise, so that anybody reading my design documentation would be able to understand the gist of my program. I wanted the reader of my document to walk away with no confusion or further questions on how my program works.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of working through a design document that I found helpful when developing the code was the document header questions that I was required to provide a response to. These were very helpful because they gave me a guide on what to write in the design document that went along with my code and told me exactly what information The Gaming Room wanted me to provide. This was helpful because I did not have to worry about guessing what they wanted to hear and ending up leaving out important information.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would revise the requirements section. Even though this section is not required by the client, I would still list out the client's business and technical requirements, just so the client can know exactly what they must need to be able to run my software, formatted in a neat, easily readable list at the beginning of the document. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by envisioning what features would need to be implemented into my program for the user to successfully play the Draw It or Lose it game with other players. I implemented them through the use of a TODO list, which were a list of specific functionalities that I needed to add to make the game meet the user's needs. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because the user is the main person who the game software is catered to. It would be a waste of time and resources to make a product that the intended user is not interested in playing.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software with a mindset of "What needs to get done"? I would focus on what functionalities of the software are missing or lacking in regard to providing the user the intended gaming experience, and then work on each functionality one by one to make them fulfill their intended purpose. I would use this same strategy in the future to analyze and design a similar software application, with the intended purpose of breaking down exactly what needs to get done so the game application can work as intended.
